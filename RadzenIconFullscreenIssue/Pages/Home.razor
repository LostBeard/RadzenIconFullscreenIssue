<h1>RadzenIcon Fullscreen Issue</h1>

<div>
    <div>
        If you use a RadzenIcon with the icon "fullscreen" and then try to make an element fullscreen using element.requestFullscreen() the document will be made fullscreen, not the element.
        <br /><br />
        The issue will persist even if the RadzenIcon is changed or removed (for example, when the page changes.)
        <br /><br />
        The only fix is to not use the icon "fullscreen" for the RadzenIcon at all if you need element.requestFullscreen to function as expected.
        <br /><br />
        Using a RadzenIcon with the icon "fullscreen" and is located outside of an element that tries to go fullscreen
        the entire document will be made fullscreen instead of the element but only in Google Chrome. Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox work as expected.
        <br />
        <br />
        This can be tested by clicking the button below to call "requestFullscreen()" on the "grapes" div.<br />
        <br />
        The entire document will be made fullscreen instead of the div that called "requestFullscreen()".
        <br />
        <br />
        Renaming the icon used below to something other than "fullscreen" (like "expand_circle_up") and restarting the app will fix the issue.
        <br />
        <br />
        This issue has been tested and found to exist in Google Chrome 133 on Windows 10 and macOS Sequoia.

        There are 2 pages in this demo. One with the fullscreen icon and one without. Click the links below to navigate between the pages.<br/>
        NOTE: Once you load the page with the fullscreen icon, the issue will persist until you restart the app.
